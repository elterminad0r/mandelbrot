# The usage of the "mandelbrot" program:

general:

    r - Reset
    [esc] - exit

    changing the scale:
    left click to zoom in
    right click to centre

    b - zoom Back out
    space - zoom in
    z - zoom in a lot

    o - subtler zoom in
    p - subtler zoom out

changing "multibrot value" (exponent of z)

    0 - increase multibrot value
    9 - decrease multibrot value

changing iteration cap:

    h - set iteration limit to 1000
    i - increase limit by 100
    u - decrease limit by 100
    t - set limit to 100

move screen:

    [left]  - move the screen left
    [right] - move the screen right
    [up]    - move the screen up
    [down]  - move the screen down

    a - move the screen left a smaller amount
    d - move the screen right a smaller amount
    w - move the screen up a smaller amount
    s - move the screen down a smaller amount

resize screen:

    1 - decrease width
    2 - increase width
    3 - decrease height
    4 - increase height

    5 - decrease width a smaller amount
    6 - increase width a smaller amount
    7 - decrease height a smaller amount
    8 - increase height a smaller amount

    f - set screen size to full screen
    y - set screen size to 700*700

    v - force rerender the display. use liberally when resizing

    q - get stats

saving pictures and serializing:

    k - save an image of the sketch - Keep it
    l - get the expected filename (serialization) to save

my way to get nice pictures: find something you think will look interesting,
and do rough navigation in a low limit and small screen size, THEN enhance and
set to full screen.
